\*Project Description

I want to make a trivia game with riddles as the questions. I am going to have 3 levels. I want to make it troll bridge themed like you have to answer the troll's riddles to get across the bridge.

\*User stories

-as a player I want to have challenging questions so I can feel satisfied when I get them correct.
-as a player I want an entertaining UI so I can be stimulated visually.
-as a player I want to be able to see my score as I play.
-as a user I want to be rewarded for winning for motivation.

\*MVP Goals

-make functions
-Make creative and appealing UI.(decent looking)
-Make a scoreboard
-Have a visual of a bridge and troll

\*Stretch Goals

-Make player show progress by moving across bridge.
-Have troll have reactions to players answers.
-Make 3 levels of the game each gets more challenging.

\*Problems & Hurdles

I did not get to reach my stretch goals. I had trouble meeting MVP and spent most of my time trying to write my javascript code. This was a challenge for me to piece everything together and have it work. I wish I would have done more pseudocoding.
